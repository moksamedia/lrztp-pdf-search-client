Copy pdfs from shared folder to 'pdfs-to-process' folder
Rename them to have "Lesson X - " at the beginning (except the main LRZTP 9 ... file)
- these filenames will be the key names in the elasticsearch db
Edit the 'process-scripts/pdfs-to-process/fields.properties' file
Run bash process-all.sh from 'pdf-search/process-scripts'
- this will perform the page splitting and ocr
- outputs files to 'process-scripts/pdf-output'
- a directory for each processed file is made
(Make sure express server and elasticsearch server are running)
If all is well, run 'node processpdfs.js'
Copy pdf files from `process-scripts/pdfs-to-process/` to 'client/public/pdfs' and 'process-scripts/processed-pdfs'
Delete pdfs from 'pdfs-to-process' folder
